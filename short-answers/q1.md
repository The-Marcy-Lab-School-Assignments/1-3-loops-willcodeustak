# Question

In what situations is a `while` loop better than a `for` loop?

# Answer

A `while` loop is better used for cases where you are uncertain of the range , or more specifically there is no certain "destination" or conclusion.

Since a for loop means for every-time this or that is done - do this.

A for `while` would be for uncertain of # of iterations.

# Teacher Feedback

You were able to properly explain a while loop however I want to reiterate that a for loop is used when you are performing the same action for a set amount of times, meaning that there is a stopping condition that is clear.
