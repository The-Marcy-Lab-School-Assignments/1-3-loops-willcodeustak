# Question

Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i);
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but _without_ using the `break` statement?

# Answer

We can either use `continue` instead of `break` to make sure that the loop doesn't `console.log(i)` if `i > 7`. Or, instead we can re-declare the for loop like this: `for (let i = 0; i < 8); i++) {}`.
